This is a sample program that I wrote to learn more about using dialog  
boxes. It is not a perfect program but is useful . I have include the 'C'
source so other people can make modifications to better suit there needs.
   If anyone has suggestions on how to improve this program please let me
know. I can be reached on my BBS. Following is the info on it:

				      Compu-Plane
				      818 843-3507  300/1200/2400
				      818 843-4874  300/1200/2400/9600 on a Courier HST.
Both lines are 8,N,1 and are available 24 hrs a day. The BBS is also running 
in the protected mode of OS/2.

   There are two main menu selections. The first allows you to select the 
search parameters. The current drive is the default. This dialog box uses four can 
different styes of dialog entries(Listbox,Edit box,checkbox, and Pushbotton).
The second selection is the exit selection. It seems to make most users more
comfortable to have this selection, even though you can close it with the
system menu.

   Hopefully this example will help others develop OS/2 PM applications. You 
are free to pass this program along to others.
